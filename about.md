### James Lai - a guy who likes to play with data

I'm a data scientist with a background in marketing and advertising.  Having worked with various data sources in the past, I am familiar with how data-driven decisions can help benefit business.  This is particularly relevant given the current rate of data creation in an ever-increasingly connected world.

Big data & machine learning techniques allows for a greater level of insight, allowing us to make sense of complex real-world situations.  Hopefully this can be used for the betterment of the world, rather than creating our own dystopian future where we need to bow down to our robotic overlords.
